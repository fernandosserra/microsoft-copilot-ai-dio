# Input 8

For this exercise, we need to open this [page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/12-generative-ai.html) on Microsoft Learning.

There are a section named "Use Copilot to compose an email"

We're asked to change the Copilot Pane to Compose section, using this prompt "Request a meeting with an investment bank to discuss funding for a commercial cleaning business." whit a professional tone, an e-mail format and a medium length. So we get this [output](https://github.com/fernandosserra/microsoft-copilot-ai-dio/blob/main/outputs/Output_8.png?raw=true):

## Output 8

Dear Goliath National Bank,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a meeting to discuss potential funding opportunities for my commercial cleaning business. Our company has experienced significant growth and we are exploring options to expand our operations further.

We believe that with the right financial backing, we can scale our services to meet the increasing demand in the market. I am keen to present our business plan and discuss how an investment could be mutually beneficial.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting at your earliest convenience. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss this exciting prospect with you.

Thank you for considering my request.

Warm regards,


Fernando A. Souza Serra
