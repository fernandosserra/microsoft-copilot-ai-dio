# Input 1

For this exercise, we need to open this [page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/12-generative-ai.html) on Microsoft Learning.

In this input, we're asked to open a document in Microsoft Word Online. The document is about a business plan.

In the step six of the instructions, we're asked to use our first prompt, "What is this document about?", so we get this [output](https://github.com/fernandosserra/microsoft-copilot-ai-dio/blob/main/outputs/Output_1.png).
