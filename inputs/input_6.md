For this exercise, we need to open this [page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/12-generative-ai.html) on Microsoft Learning.

The third section of the page is named "Use Copilot to create content for a presentation"

Or sixth prompt is "Write a summary of the benefits of using a corporate cleaning company for your business. The summary should consist of five short bullet points."

So we get this [output](https://github.com/fernandosserra/microsoft-copilot-ai-dio/blob/main/outputs/Output_6.png?raw=true):
