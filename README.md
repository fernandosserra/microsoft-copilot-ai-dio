# Bootcamp Microsoft Copilot AI
This repository is for the bootcamp Microsoft Copilot AI, from Digital Innovation One.

## Introduction

I started this bootcamp to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and the Copilot features that Microsoft is making available for free on several platforms.

It is with pleasure and much more knowledge that I reach the end of it.


## Steps
Open this [page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/12-generative-ai.html) on Microsoft Learning.

Open Copilot Panel.

Do the instructions

## Conclusion

In this exercise, Iâ€™ve used Copilot in Microsoft Edge to find information and generate content. 

It was a rewarding experience to discover that AI can bring me so many benefits in such a short time. I spent approximately 30 minutes and left with a business plan, a presentation and an investment contact.

I will definitely use AI more in my routine.
